I have always been interested in the field of web development.  
In 2015 she graduated from BNTU with a degree in web-designer, programmer. During the training at BNTU, two sites were made up (drawing a layout in Photoshop, site layout, placement), there is basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, the basics of Photoshop and CorelDRAW.  
At the current place of work, the acquired knowledge is applied partially, basically it all comes down to site administration, filling it with content, developing banners. I want to develop in this direction and subsequently change the field of activity. At the moment I want to get the missing knowledge to start a career in IT. I started learning English in 2021 and plan to study further. At the moment, the level of English is beginner (A1), Underground certificate.
